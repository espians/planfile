In addition to single/multiple local files, the selector should also support uploading files from:

* Dropbox
* Facebook
* Instagram
* Web Links

If `getUserMedia` is available, then it should enable:

* Taking pictures.
* Recording videos.
* Recording voice.

And, finally, a corresponding save dialog should be available which allows for downloading files directly or saving to Dropbox.
