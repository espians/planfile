Ambient Auth is a mechanism for verifying that people are authorised to use certain physical resources based on their ability to prove that they are who they claim to be. 

The design of ambient auth is such that the person wishing to use a resource (e.g. a screen or vehicle) has an application running on their mobile device. By following a defined process in the application, they can be authenticated via NFC, QR codes or beeps.
