* [Fabulous](http://fabulous.com/) provide an [executive lock feature](http://fabulous.com/informationcenter/index.htm?formdata%5Bqid%5D=115) that freezes a domain's registry settings. Since it can only be removed by Fabulous management after custom conditions specified by us have been fulfilled, we should be able to secure it reasonably well. Unfortunately, Fabulous seems to be available to only those with a portfolio of 750+ domains.

* [MarkMonitor](https://www.markmonitor.com/) are the registrar used by Google and Facebook. They seem to take security seriously â€” it's even the first item mentioned in their [domain management offering](https://www.markmonitor.com/services/domain-management.php). However they are also several magnitudes more expensive than what we can currently afford.
