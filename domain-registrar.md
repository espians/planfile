Our domains have historically been registered at [gandi.net](http://www.gandi.net/) and [BulkRegister](http://www.bulkregister.com/). They have served us well over the years but, as we move forward, we need to find a more security conscious registrar that would protect us from the [very](http://www.secretgeek.net/sg_hijack_1.asp) [real](http://css-tricks.com/this-sites-domain-is-now-safe/) [threat](http://www.darknet.org.uk/2006/09/domain-stealing-or-how-to-hijack-a-domain/) of [domain hijacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hijacking).

Very few registrars seem to actively publicise their security measures. Of the few that do:

* [Fabulous](http://fabulous.com/) provide an [executive lock feature](http://fabulous.com/informationcenter/index.htm?formdata%5Bqid%5D=115) that freezes a domain's registry settings. Since it can only be removed by Fabulous management after custom conditions specified by us have been fulfilled, we should be able to secure it reasonably well. Unfortunately, Fabulous seems to be available to only those with a portfolio of 750+ domains.

* [Go Daddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) provide registry level locking as the Deadbolt Transfer Protection part of their [Protected Registration service](http://www.godaddy.com/domainaddon/protected-registration.aspx). Unfortunately, they are elephant killing, SOPA supporting scum who can't even [keep their services running properly](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2012/09/10/5-reasons-you-should-leave-godaddy-and-how/) and [take over 3 days to just respond to a hijacking](http://hubsacademy.com/933/godaddy-fails-on-howardforum-domain-theft/).

* [MarkMonitor](https://www.markmonitor.com/) are the registrar used by Google and Facebook. They seem to take security seriously â€” it's even the first item mentioned in their [domain management offering](https://www.markmonitor.com/services/domain-management.php). However they are also several magnitudes more expensive than what we can currently afford.

* [Moniker](https://www.moniker.com/) provide an affordable and seemingly robust [MaxLock domain protection service](https://www.moniker.com/domainnames/domainsecurity.jsp) which requires offline verification before changes can be initiated. Unfortunately, it sounds like their [service and support has been deteriorating](http://morganlinton.com/throwing-in-the-towel-with-moniker-lack-of-support-leaves-domainers-hanging/) in recent times including a number of [system-wide outages](http://domaingang.com/tag/moniker-outage/).
